My project is a pokemon battle simulator.
It takes real pokemon data from PokeAPI and inputs it into my game and then simulates a battle between two pokemon.
My project takes into consideration typing, stats, stab, nature, and many other pokemon mechanics.
Thank you for trying my game

Instructions to use my project: 

play the game by running PokemonBattleGUI

then input two pokemon and press start battle

The first pokemon you input is your pokemon and the second pokemon is the opponents pokemon

press attack to utilize the moves that the pokemon has to attack the opponent and knock out the opponent before your pokemon faints
